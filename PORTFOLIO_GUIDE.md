## 💼 Client FAQ Preparation

Be ready to answer:

**Q: Can you scrape other websites?**
A: Yes! The system uses a factory pattern making it easy to add new scrapers. I can extend it to any e-commerce site.

**Q: How do you handle anti-scraping measures?**
A: The system includes user-agent rotation, random delays, retry logic, and respectful rate limiting.

**Q: Can this be deployed to the cloud?**
A: Absolutely! It can run on AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean, or any VPS. I can provide Docker configuration.

**Q: What if the website layout changes?**
A: The scrapers use multiple selectors as fallbacks. I also include logging to quickly identify and fix issues.

**Q: Can you add more features?**
A: Yes! The modular architecture makes it easy to add features like Telegram alerts, web dashboard, API endpoints, etc.

## 📊 Metrics to Highlight
